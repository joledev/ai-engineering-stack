# SDD Verify

Verify `$ARGUMENTS` against its acceptance criteria. You start with no
conversation history: everything you need is in this file, the repo, and GitHub.

## 1. Resolve the acceptance criteria

`$ARGUMENTS` is one of:

- **A path to a spec file**: read the acceptance criteria from it.
- **A Task ID** (`BE-AUTH-1-T1`), **Story ID** (`BE-AUTH-1`) or **issue number** (`#42`),
  from a backlog made by `prd-to-github-backlog`. Titles are `"<ID>: <title>"`;
  a Task's Story is its ID without the trailing `-T<k>`.

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner,defaultBranchRef \
  --jq '.nameWithOwner + " " + .defaultBranchRef.name'
gh issue list --label type:story --state all --search "in:title <STORY_ID>" \
  --json number,title --jq '.[] | select(.title | startswith("<STORY_ID>:")) | .number'
gh issue view <story#>       # Given/When/Then acceptance criteria live here
gh issue view <task#>        # for a Task: its scope narrows which criteria apply
```

For a raw `#N`, check its `type:*` label; a `type:task` walks up to its parent
Story (`gh api repos/<owner/repo>/issues/<N>/parent --jq '.number'`).

If several Stories match, use the open one (else the most recent) and name the
one you used in the report. If their acceptance criteria are identical, say so:
the choice does not change the review.

If no acceptance criteria can be found, or they are not testable (no observable
outcome), stop and report exactly that. Do not invent criteria.

## 2. Identify the change under review

```bash
git status --porcelain
git diff HEAD                  # uncommitted: the task in progress
git diff <BASE>...HEAD         # committed on this branch
```

If the working tree has changes, review those (the current task). If it is
clean, review `<BASE>...HEAD`. Read every changed file in full, not only the hunks.

**In scope** = the lines that implement this Story/Task. If the diff also carries
other work, review it only for the "Outside this change" section; it never
decides the verdict.

Judge an in-scope line by what it does to the product, not only against the AC.
If it breaks behavior that worked on the base, or leaves the Story's feature
unreachable from the product's real entry points (API, UI), it is [blocking]
even when every criterion passes as written. The missing piece may live outside
the diff; the in-scope line that depends on it is what blocks.

## 3. Load the project's rules

Find the context index: `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root, else `.claude/CLAUDE.md`,
else the parent directory's `.claude/` (monorepo). Read it and the files it links
under Engineering and Business, mainly `engineering/standards.md`,
`engineering/testing.md`, `business/rules.md`.

## 4. Run the tests

Use the commands from `engineering/testing.md`; otherwise the project's own
(`npm test`, `pnpm test`, `dotnet test`, `./gradlew test`). Record what actually
ran and the result. If they could not run, say why. Never report "tests pass"
without running them.

If a test fails, check whether it also fails without the change: run it in a
scratch worktree (`git worktree add --detach "$(mktemp -d)" HEAD` for
uncommitted work, `<BASE>` for committed work), then `git worktree remove` it.
Never stash or touch the real working tree: other reviewers read it in
parallel. Failures that already exist on the base are reported as
**pre-existing** and do not count toward the verdict.

Rely on the project's existing tests. Do not build your own harness (scratch
apps, ad-hoc HTTP clients, containers) unless an in-scope criterion has no test
at all; then the smallest check that proves it. The browser check below is
the one exception.

### Browser check (web projects only)

Run it only when the project is web (Next.js, React, any app served to a
browser) AND an in-scope criterion describes something visible in the UI
(rendered content, a form, navigation, an error message on screen). Skip it
for backend-only or API-only criteria.

1. Check the tool: `command -v ego-browser || ls ~/.local/bin/ego-browser`.
   Missing → do not install it. Mark those criteria `~ PARTIAL (ego-browser
   not installed, UI not checked)` and go on.
2. Read `~/.claude/skills/ego-browser/SKILL.md` before writing any script.
   Its API is not Playwright; use only what that file lists.
3. Start the project's dev server (command from `engineering/testing.md`,
   else `package.json` scripts) in the background, on a free port.
4. Use one TaskSpace for the whole check. Drive the flow the criterion
   describes, through the UI the user would use. Record the URL, the steps,
   and what the snapshot showed.
5. Stop the dev server when done.

A criterion confirmed in the browser counts as ✓ even with no automated test
for that layer; cite the steps and snapshot as evidence. If the browser shows
the criterion failing, it is ✗ regardless of what the tests say.

## 5. Verify

- **Spec 1, acceptance criteria:** only the criteria this change is due to
  satisfy. Check behavior, not that some code exists for it.
  ✓ = a test exercises the behavior (at any layer) and passes.
  ~ PARTIAL = the code does it but no test proves it.
  A layer the AC names but no test covers (e.g. the HTTP status) is a minor
  finding, not a downgrade.
- **Spec 2, code quality** (in-scope lines only): duplication, naming,
  architecture boundaries, control flow, error handling, function size, dead
  code, tests that exercise the real path instead of a mock of it, and tests
  that seed state the product's own entry points cannot produce.

Write the reasoning before each verdict.

## 6. Report

```
VERDICT: PASS | FAIL   <ID> — <title>   (Story #<n>)
Tests: <command> → <result>   [pre-existing failures: <list or none>]

Acceptance criteria
  ✓ AC1 <criterion>: <evidence, file:line>
  ✗ AC2 <criterion>: <what is missing, file:line>
  ~ AC3 <criterion>: PARTIAL, <why>

Code quality, in scope (blocking first)
  [blocking] file:line — <issue>
  [minor]    file:line — <issue>

Outside this change (never blocking)
  file:line — <issue>
```

FAIL if any criterion is ✗ or ~, a test fails because of this change, tests
could not run, or there is an in-scope blocking finding.

## Hard rules

- Report only. No edits, no commits, no issue comments, no closing issues.
- Every ✗ and every finding cites file:line.
- Never guess. If the implementation cannot be found, say so.
